# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. Building this website allowed for hands-on learning and practice of HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. This project allows students a submersive introduction to the course materials. By the end of the project, students have an organized way of recording keys points to reference back to in their studies.
